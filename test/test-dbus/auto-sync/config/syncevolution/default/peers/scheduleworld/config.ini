# 0
#   don't do auto sync

# This is the minimum number of seconds between two
# synchronizations that has to pass before starting
# an automatic synchronization. Can be specified using
# a 1h30m5s format.
# 
# Before reducing this interval, consider that it will
# increase resource consumption on the local and remote
# side. Some SyncML server operators only allow a
# certain number of sessions per day.
# The value 0 has the effect of only running automatic
# synchronization when changes are detected (not
# implemented yet, therefore it basically disables
# automatic synchronization).
autoSyncInterval = 60m

# An automatic sync will not be started unless the peer
# has been available for this duration, specified in seconds
# or 1h30m5s format.
# 
# This prevents running a sync when network connectivity
# is unreliable or was recently established for some
# other purpose. It is also a heuristic that attempts
# to predict how long connectivity be available in the
# future, because it should better be available long
# enough to complete the synchronization.
# autoSyncDelay = 5M

# During a slow sync, the SyncML server must match all items
# of the client with its own items and detect which ones it
# already has based on properties of the items. This is slow
# (client must send all its data) and can lead to duplicates
# (when the server fails to match correctly).
# It is therefore sometimes desirable to wipe out data on one
# side with a refresh-from-client/server sync instead of doing
# a slow sync.
# When this option is enabled, slow syncs that could cause problems
# are not allowed to proceed. Instead, the affected sources are
# skipped, allowing the user to choose a suitable sync mode in
# the next run (slow sync selected explicitly, refresh sync).
# The following situations are handled:
# 
# - running as client with no local data => unproblematic,
#   slow sync is allowed to proceed automatically
# - running as client with local data => client has no
#   information about server, so slow sync might be problematic
#   and is prevented
# - client has data, server asks for slow sync because all its data
#   was deleted (done by Memotoo and Mobical, because they treat
#   this as 'user wants to start from scratch') => the sync would
#   recreate all the client's data, even if the user really wanted
#   to have it deleted, therefore slow sync is prevented

# The total amount of time in seconds in which the SyncML
# client tries to get a response from the server.
# During this time, the client will resend messages
# in regular intervals (RetryInterval) if no response
# is received or the message could not be delivered due
# to transport problems. When this time is exceeded
# without a response, the synchronization aborts without
# sending further messages to the server.

# When acting as server, this setting controls how long
# a client is allowed to not send a message before the
# synchronization is aborted.
# RetryDuration = 5M

# The number of seconds between the start of SyncML message sending
# and the start of the retransmission. If the interval has
# already passed when a message send returns, the
# message is resent immediately. Resending without
# any delay will never succeed and therefore specifying 0
# disables retries.
# 
# Servers cannot resend messages, so this setting has no
# effect in that case.
# 
# The WebDAV backend also resends messages after a temporary
# network error. It uses exponential backoff to determine when
# the server is available again. This setting is divided by 24
# to obtain the initial delay (default: 2m => 5s), which is then
# doubled for each retry.
